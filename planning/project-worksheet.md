# Project Overview

## Project Description

For Project Three of the General Assembly SEI course, we were assigned to create a website that shows our knowledge and understanding of CRUD and RESTful APIs. We have to create the backend using Ruby on Rails. We create our frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

For this project, we will be building a video hosting website (using Youtube API) and host videos pertaining specifically to web developers. Using Ruby on Rails, we create different models to represent how users can input their data. Afterwards, we worked on controllers that will allow users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) comments on the website. Finally, we need to put them in the routes so the backend and the frontend can communicate with one another.

## User Stories

- Users see a grid of videos on homepage
- Users can click on one video to watch it on the video player
- Users can create their own accounts
- Users can log in and comment on each video
- Users can edit comments or delete them
- Users can navigate using the navigation bar
- Users can like and dislike videos
