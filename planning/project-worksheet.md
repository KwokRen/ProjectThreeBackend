# Project Overview

## Project Description

For Project Three of the General Assembly SEI course, we were assigned to create a website that shows our knowledge and understanding of CRUD and RESTful APIs. We have to create the backend using Ruby on Rails. We create our frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

For this project, we will be building a video hosting website (using Youtube API) and host videos pertaining specifically to web developers. Using Ruby on Rails, we create different models to represent how users can input their data. Afterwards, we worked on controllers that will allow users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) their information on the website. Finally, we need to put them in the routes so the backend and the frontend can communicate with one another.

## Project Schedule

Here is our schedule for each day and what we hope to accomplish. This is to keep track of how our project is going.

### MVP / PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Build and Test Authentication (JWT)
- Build Models 
- Test Models with Authentication 
- Testing done on Postman
- Deploy and Test Deployed API
- Importing all the dependencies on our Gemfile
- Create the controllers
- Create the routes

#### PostMVP 

- Search functionality
- More models
- Categorizing videos
- Fixing errors
- Refactoring
